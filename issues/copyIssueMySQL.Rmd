Copy issue with `MySQL`.

<!-- Generated from .Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = " # "
)
options(width =100)
```

`MySQL` doesn't obey `overwrite=TRUE`, but since that is in the `...` region it is hard to say what correct behavior would be.  `replyr` already works around it, this is just to explain why we take the trouble.

```{r copyissueover, error=TRUE}
library('dplyr')
library('RMySQL')
packageVersion('dplyr')
packageVersion('RMySQL')
my_db <- dplyr::src_sqlite("replyr_sqliteEx.sqlite3", create = TRUE)
d <- dplyr::copy_to(my_db,data.frame(x=c(1,2)),'d')
d <- dplyr::copy_to(my_db,data.frame(x=c(1,2)),'d')
```


```{r printversion}
version
```
